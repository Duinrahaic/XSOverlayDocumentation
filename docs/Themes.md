# Themes
> Themes are created using the SDK, and allow you to skin different parts of XSOverlay's UI by creating custom shaders.

!> **Installing a theme**
<br><br>Themes should be installed by copying the folder output by the SDK to the correct location.
<br>Themes are located at `[XSOINSTALLDIRECTORY]/XSOverlay_Data/StreamingAssets/Themes/`
<br><br> After creating a theme with the SDK, copy the output folder into the correct folder in the themes location. (E.g. WristBackground themes would go under the Wrist Folder)
